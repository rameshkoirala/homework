/* problem 2.8.2 polynomial

    Write a move assignment operator for the polynomial in Exercise 2.8.1
    Define the copy constructor as default. To test whether your assignment is
    used write a function polynomial f(double c2, double c1, double c0) that
    takes three coefficient and returns a polynomial. Print out a message in
    your move assignment or use a debugger to make sure your assignment is used.

Move Assignment Operator:
    Wiki: Move assignment operator = is used for transferring a temporary object to an existing 
    object. The move assignment operator, like most C++ operators, can be overloaded.
    
    https://blog.smartbear.com/c-plus-plus/c11-tutorial-introducing-the-move-constructor-and-
        the-move-assignment-operator/
    The move assignment operator performs four logical steps:
        1. Release any resources that *this currently owns.
        2. Pilfer polynomialâ€˜s resource.
        3. Set polynomial to a default state.
        4. Return *this.
    
Copy Constructor:
    The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with 
    an object of the same class, which has been created previously. The copy constructor 
    is used to:
        1. Initialize one object from another of the same type.
        2. Copy an object to pass it as an argument to a function.
        3. Copy an object to return it from a function.
    If a copy constructor is not defined in a class, the compiler itself defines one
